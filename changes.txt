[#] v0.04 (release 6) (13.02.2006):

 - [Changed] Program name to LBA Story Coder. Now with this name we can automaticly know what this program could do ;)
 - [Changed] Now working with both Binary and Text mode formats. You can also set this program in LBA Package Editor tool for scene files.
 - [Changed] Scene file types according with LBA Package Editor.
 - [Changed] Actors/Zones/Tracks X,Y,Z coordinates edits. Now we can put the right coordinates according with the grids. Anyway the scrolls are there for a fast change, but I suggest to use the edits. For example each layer in LBArchitech increase 256 in Y position. That way you can easly set a new coordination for your actor/zone/track. Also added feature to disabled this.
 - [Changed] Actor display in a new window. This time only image of actors are displayed. Future versions will have the 3D model viewer compatible.

 - [Enabled] Zones and Tracks again. Now fully compatible.
 - [Enabled] "Is sprite actor" check box under Actor Static Parameters window because the creation of new actors in scenes.

 - [Added] Compitble for LBA2 scenes. You can now also edit some of the scene definitions. Note that this are yet in tests and isn't all compatible.
 - [Added] New file type, LBA Story Coder Project (*.scp), to save parameters according with the script. This will save all scene content in a special format where we'll have also the script comments that will not be under the binary/text exported scenes.
 - [Added] Association file type for all compatible files (*.scp, *.ls1, *.ls2 and *.sce)
 - [Added] New option under Zones tabs where we could set diferent types of Zones. Only for LBA1 scenes for now.
 - [Added] Completely actor script decode with indent.
 - [Added] New option to display actor scripts with syntax hightligh. (Experimental) (can slow a bit script load, you need to wait 1/2 seconds :/)
 - [Added] New window with script help. Now you can see what you exactly are doing in the script. Note that this is only available for LBA1 scenes.
 - [Added] New options under atmosphere tab where we could see some scene enviroment options (Experimental because I need to know first what they are exactly).
 - [Added] Lots of new options under Settings menu.
 - [Added] Feature to read content of File3D.HQR file for restringe body/anim entities for each actor. This only work for now with LBA1 scenes. When LBA2 will be more compatible I'll do such thing since isn't so diferent.
 - [Added] Feature to open the grid related with the opened scene. Note that the file name must have the scene number before the scene name like LBAPackEd did (e.g. scene001_something or 001_something). (Experimental)
 - [Added] Also added feature to manipulate Tracks, Zones and Actors under LBArchitect. (Experimental)
 - [Added] Comentary character for script code. Use 'REM' when you want to make a comentary under the script code in a new line. 
           (
	    - RIGHT example:

		REM first commentary
		LABEL 1
		ANIM 5
		REM second commentary
		STOP
		END

    	    - WRONG example: (not supported in this version)

		LABEL 1 REM first commentary
		ANIM 5
		STOP REM second commentary
		END
	   )

 - [Fixed] Actor and static parameter windows when we close a scene inside the program. (They were always opened)
 - [Fixed] Bugs in Actor, Tracks and Zones New, Clone and Remove options. This is also now compatible with LBArchitect.
